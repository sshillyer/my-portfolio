# About this GitHub Portfolio

This is a collection of selected projects that demonstrate my use of various programming languages and development stacks. Some projects are incomplete or imperfect, but as a Computer Science student, I'm always being pressed to move forward to the next topic by reality and my own curiousity.

This portfolio is organized into the several categories (with my favorite project from each language selected). Here are a few highlights:

* C: Significant programs created using the C programming language. The operating-systems sub-folder contains select projects that interact with the Linux operating system calls to complete non-trivial tasks. In particular, small-shell is a complex project that utilizes the fork() system call to create foreground and background processes, parses user input, and has several built-in shell commands of its own.

* CPP: These C++ programs demonstrate some fundamental Object-Oriented Design practices. My favorite is "Bermuda-Diangle", my final project for an early class in my Computer Science curriculum and was a joy to create. It includes uses of inheritance, polymorphism, and a wide variety of classes are presented. This custom game, designed entirely by me, is also a fun diversion, so take a minute and "dive" in to the adventure by using the makefile included.

* Java: At the time of writing, Java is not covered or used in any of the classes I've taken so far. However, while learning Data Structures using the C programming language (University's choice), I decided to implement a few of the data structures as we went to try and expose myself to the language and learn the structures while programming in higher level of abstraction.

* MS-Assembly: These programs are all school projects written using the Microsoft Macro Assembler. A lot of the higher-level abstractions were prohibited in the interest of learning.

* Web Stack: These projects include a projects written using some combination of HTML, JavaScript, and Node.js (using express and handlebars, generally speaking). I also like to leverage bootstrap for quick prototypes, so you'll see some applications of that here. I wrote a guide on using JavaScript to create class-like behavior in JavaScript. The project utilizes all of the affore-mentioned technologies to create a simple, responsive page with lots of code samples. 


Projects "coming soon":

* CS344 (Operating Systems): A "one-time-pad" encryption/decryption client and server program in C.

* CS340 (Databases): Poli-Race-2016, a web interface that allows a user to input data and run a few 'canned' queries on a MySQL database. Uses HTML, PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap.
