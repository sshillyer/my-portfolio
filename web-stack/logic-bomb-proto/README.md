# About
This is a project to make a copycat version of the classic Minesweeper game. This is a bit of a toy/learning project, but the plan is to implement all of the logic in JavaScript and use a simple HTML website to structure the content. Once the logic and structure is working, I will utilize CSS to mark up the site.

This is on my to-do list to research more, but the intent is for this to be an open-source project. If you wish to contribute, please contact me or issue a pull request.
