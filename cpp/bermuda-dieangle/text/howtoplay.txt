= HOW TO PLAY ======================================================
- Movement ---------------------------------------------------------
Each area will be a mystery to you as you explore the ocean.
In order to find a way out, you must search for an exit in one
of four directions. Once you've found an exit, you can move
in that direction.

- Oxygen -----------------------------------------------------------
You have limited oxygen. If you your oxygen reaches zero, you
suffocate and die! Find extra oxygen tanks by exploring the deep
sea!

- Inventory --------------------------------------------------------
Your Diving Belt has a plethora of hooks that allow you to drag a
huge selection of items with you as you travel the ocean floor. You
are a professional deep sea treasure hunter, you know!

Access your inventory using the menu at almost any point. From
there, you can see a list of your objects. You can read a hint about
its use, use the item, or drop it to make room for something else.

Make sure you keep track of your inventory before you explore an
area! If you run out of space and find something nice, you may be
forced to leave it behind - the ocean is a dangerous place!

- Objective --------------------------------------------------------
You are trying to survive and make it back home. How you do so is
up to you, and fate! If you collect treasure while you're out there,
you get to keep the goods and brag to your friends.
